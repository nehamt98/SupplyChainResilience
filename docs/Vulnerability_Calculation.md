**Vulnerability calculation metrics**

Based on the feedback and the literature, we have chosen the following 3
metrics. These metrics together provide a structured way to assess risk
by looking at how concentrated the supply is, how diverse the suppliers
are, and how dependent the country is on imports. All these are
calculated between a particular good and a particular country.

1.  Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

> $$HHI\  = \ \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left( \frac{(Import\ Value\ from\ Country\ i)}{(Total\ Import\ Value)} \right)^{2}$$

The HHI helps us understand whether a country is too reliant on a small
number of suppliers. It calculates market concentration by summing the
squares of each supplier's market share. If HHI is close to 1, the
market is highly concentrated, meaning supply is controlled by just a
few countries, which is a high risk scenario. If HHI is closer to 0, the
supply is well-distributed across many suppliers, meaning low risk.

2.  Supplier Diversity Score

> $$S\  = \frac{(Number\ of\ Supplying\ Countries)}{(Total\ Number\ of\ Suppliers)}$$
>
> The Supplier Diversity Score measures how many countries supply a
> particular good to the country in question compared to the total number of exporters. 
> A country importing from many different suppliers is more
> resilient, while one importing from just a few is at risk. A value close
> to 1 means the country has good supplier diversity (low risk), whereas
> a value closer to 0 indicates dependence on very few suppliers (high
> risk).

3.  Import dependency index

> $$IDI\  = \frac{\left( \max(0,\ Imports\  - \ Exports) \right)}{(Imports)}$$
>
> IDI tells us whether a country relies entirely on imports or has
> domestic production to fall back on. If a country exports just as much
> as it imports, its dependency is low, meaning even if imports are
> disrupted, there is little impact. On the other hand, if it imports
> far more than it exports, it has high dependency, meaning higher risk.
> The IDI is calculated as the difference between imports and exports,
> divided by total imports. If IDI is close to 1, the country is highly
> dependent on imports (high risk). If IDI is close to 0, the country is
> self-sufficient (low risk).
>
> This metric is required for the case where the first 2 metrics may
> show that a particular country is at risk for a certain commodity but
> in fact they have enough domestic production to not rely on other
> countries for import.

**Final Supply Chain Risk Index**

$$SCRI\  = \frac{HHI\  + \ (1\  - \ S) + \ IDI}{3}$$

This equation ensures that all three factors contribute to the final
risk assessment. HHI captures supply concentration, so a higher value
means more risk. (1 - S) ensures that lower supplier diversity increases
risk, since fewer suppliers mean fewer backup options. IDI accounts for
how much the country relies on imports, meaning a higher IDI amplifies
the risk if supply chains are disrupted. If any of these values indicate
high risk, the overall score will be higher. The final SCRI value ranges
from 0 to 1, where values above 0.7 indicate significant risk, and
values below 0.3 suggest a more resilient supply chain.
